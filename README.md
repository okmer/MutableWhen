# MutableWhen
MutableWhenAny and MutableWhenAll extension for the Task Parallel Library (TPL), using a ObservableCollection.

The extension makes it possible to add or removed tasks to/from an ObservableCollection<Task> while the MutableWhenAny or MutableWhenAll is  waiting on the tasks in this (mutable) collection.
